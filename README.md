Log Levels
----------

Monolog supports the logging levels described by [PSR-3](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3).

- **DEBUG** (100): Detailed debug information.

- **INFO** (200): Interesting events. Examples: User logs in, SQL logs.

- **NOTICE** (250): Normal but significant events.

- **WARNING** (300): Exceptional occurrences that are not errors. Examples:
  Use of deprecated APIs, poor use of an API, undesirable things that are not
  necessarily wrong.

- **ERROR** (400): Runtime errors that do not require immediate action but
  should typically be logged and monitored.

- **CRITICAL** (500): Critical conditions. Example: Application component
  unavailable, unexpected exception.

- **ALERT** (550): Action must be taken immediately. Example: Entire website
  down, database unavailable, etc. This should trigger the SMS alerts and wake
  you up.

- **EMERGENCY** (600): Emergency: system is unusable.
